      <description>2019-09-04&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The term user is used in two different ways. We often speak of a logged-in person as a user, and, sometimes, use the term to refer to the process which the user is controlling from his terminal. Especially in the context of user control, however, we apply the term user to any member of the set of users (in the first sense) who could log in. In other words, we speak of a user as a registered identity.</description>
